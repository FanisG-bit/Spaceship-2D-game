          (player's health is all decreased) which is something that is caused due to
          the player colliding with the enemy, is to destroy the enemy. I believe that this
          does not cause any balancing issue since the player is getting hit, so there is
          a penalty for doing that. So it cannot be exploited by the player's 
          kamikaze attitude.
